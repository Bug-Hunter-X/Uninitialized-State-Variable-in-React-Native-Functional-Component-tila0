# Uninitialized State Variable in React Native

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native functional components: accessing a state variable before it has been initialized.  This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.

## Problem

The `uninitializedState.js` file shows an example of this error.  Attempting to use `count` before React has assigned it an initial value results in an error.

## Solution

The `uninitializedStateSolution.js` file presents the solution. It properly handles the initialization of `count` using the useState hook, ensuring the value is always defined before use.

This example highlights the importance of careful state management and utilizing React's lifecycle methods to ensure data integrity and prevent errors.
